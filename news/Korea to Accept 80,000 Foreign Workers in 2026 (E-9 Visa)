📢 Korea to Accept 80,000 Foreign Workers in 2026 (E-9 Visa)
South Korea has announced that 80,000 foreign workers will be accepted in 2026 under the E-9 Employment Permit System.
This decision shows that foreign workers are still an important part of Korea’s workforce.

Most job opportunities will be in:
🏭 Manufacturing (factories)
🌾 Agriculture and livestock
🚢 Fishing

🏗 Construction
There is also good news for those willing to work outside Seoul.
Factories in provincial areas will be allowed to hire more foreign workers, and companies that return to local regions will have fewer hiring restrictions.
The government also stated that foreign workers’ rights and job protection will continue to be strengthened, regardless of nationality.

This policy sends a clear message:
Korea will continue to rely on and protect foreign workers.
